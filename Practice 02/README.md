# Practice 2: Python Control Flow Basics

## 1. Objective

This practice focuses on learning Python control flow structures including conditionals and loops. You will work through W3Schools exercises covering Boolean operations, if-else statements, and for loops, saving all examples to your GitHub repository.

---

## 2. Tasks

### 2.1 Learn Python Control Flow from W3Schools

Read and complete exercises from W3Schools Python Tutorial (Boolean to For loops):

🔗 **W3Schools Python**: [https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp)

**Topics to Cover**:
- Boolean Values
- Booleans as Comparison Results
- Boolean Operators
- If Statement
- If Else
- If Elif Else
- Short Hand If Else
- Switch/If Elif/Else
- While Loops
- While Loop Break
- While Loop Continue
- For Loops
- For Loop Break
- For Loop Continue

**Instructions**:
- Read each section carefully
- Complete all exercises and "Try It Yourself" examples
- Save all example code to `.py` files in your repository
- Make sure your code is properly commented

### 2.2 Save Examples to GitHub

Organize and save all code examples to your GitHub repository:

**Repository Structure**:
```
Practice2/
├── boolean/
│   ├── boolean_intro.py
│   ├── boolean_comparison.py
│   └── boolean_operators.py
├── if_else/
│   ├── if_statement.py
│   ├── if_else.py
│   ├── if_elif_else.py
│   └── short_hand_if.py
├── loops/
│   ├── while_loop.py
│   ├── while_break.py
│   ├── while_continue.py
│   ├── for_loop.py
│   ├── for_break.py
│   └── for_continue.py
└── README.md
```

**Commit Instructions**:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Practice2 - Python control flow examples (boolean, if-else, loops)"
git push origin main
```

## 3. What You Must Complete?

To pass this practice, you must:

- ✅ Complete all sections from Boolean to For Loops
- ✅ Finish all "Try It Yourself" exercises
- ✅ Save all examples as separate `.py` files
- ✅ Push code to GitHub with clear commit messages
- ✅ Make at least 3 meaningful commits

**Deadline**: Before Practice 03.

## 4. 🛠 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

- **Python Syntax**: Verify your code at [https://www.w3schools.com/python/trypython.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/python/trypython.asp)
- **Git Issues**: Refer to Practice 1 resources or [Git Documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc)
- **Understanding Concepts**: Re-read the tutorial or ask during practice classes
