# Lab 7: Game Development with Pygame - Part 1

## 1. Objective

This lab introduces game development using Pygame. You will learn graphics, input handling, and animations by creating three classic games. This part focuses on basic concepts and implementation.

## 2. Resources and Learning

Start with the following tutorials:

🔗 **Nerd Paradise Pygame Tutorial**: [https://nerdparadise.com/programming/pygame](https://nerdparadise.com/programming/pygame)

**Topics to Study**:
- Getting Started with Pygame
- Working with Images
- Music and Sound Effects
- Geometric Drawing
- Fonts and Text
- More on Input (Keyboard, Mouse, Joystick)

## 3. Tasks

### 3.1 Mickey's Clock Application

**Objective**: Create a digital-style clock using Mickey Mouse hand graphics

**Requirements**:
1. Display current system time (minutes and seconds only)
2. Use Mickey Mouse's hands as clock hands
   - Right hand = minutes hand
   - Left hand = seconds hand
3. Synchronize with system clock in real-time
4. Update display every second

**Implementation Tips**:
- Use `pygame.transform.rotate()` to rotate hands
- Reference: [StackOverflow - Rotating Graphics](https://stackoverflow.com/a/54714144)
- Calculate rotation angles based on current time
- Handle edge cases (leap seconds, etc.)

### 3.2 Music Player with Keyboard Controller

**Objective**: Build an interactive music player with keyboard controls

**Requirements**:
1. Play/Stop/Next/Previous tracks with keyboard commands
2. Display current track information
3. Show playback progress or track position
4. Handle playlist management

**Keyboard Controls Example**:
- **P** = Play
- **S** = Stop
- **N** = Next track
- **B** = Previous (Back)
- **Q** = Quit

**Implementation Tips**:
- Use pygame.mixer for audio playback
- Load multiple MP3/WAV files
- Track current playlist position
- Display UI with pygame.font

│   ├── player.py
│   ├── music/
│   │   ├── track1.wav
│   │   └── track2.wav
│   └── README.md
```

### 3.3 Moving Ball Game

**Objective**: Create an interactive game with a moving red ball

**Requirements**:
1. Display a red ball (50x50 pixels, radius 25) on white background
2. Move ball with arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right)
3. Each key press moves ball by 20 pixels
4. Ball cannot leave the screen boundaries
5. Ignore input that would move ball off-screen

**Implementation Tips**:
- Use pygame.draw.circle() for the ball
- Handle keyboard events
- Check boundary conditions before moving
- Smooth animation with frame rate control

## 4. What You Must Complete?

To pass this lab, you must:

- ✅ Complete Mickey's Clock application with working clock hands
- ✅ Implement Music Player with all keyboard controls
- ✅ Create Moving Ball game with boundary checking
- ✅ Code must be well-commented and organized
- ✅ All three games must run without errors
- ✅ Push all code to GitHub with clear commit messages

**Deadline**: check MS Teams announcements

---

## 5. 🛠 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

- **Pygame Installation**: `pip install pygame`
- **Image/Sound Loading**: Verify file paths and formats
- **Rotation Issues**: Check angle calculation (0° = up, clockwise positive)
- **Event Handling**: Use pygame.event.get() correctly
- **Performance**: Check frame rate and event loop frequency
